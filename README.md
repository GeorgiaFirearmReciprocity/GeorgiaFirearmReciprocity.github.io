## Purpose of this Site
After researching Georgia's [firearm license reciprocity laws](https://dps.georgia.gov/georgias-firearm-permit-reciprocity) and discussing this topic with various lawyers and law enforcement officials, I realized that there are two common topics of confusion:

* Does Georgia recognize concealed carry licenses validly issued by other states to non-residents?
  * Example: Does Georgia recognize a valid New Hampshire "[Non-Resident Pistol/Revolver License](https://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/nhsp/ssb/permitslicensing/plupr.html)" issued to a Massachusetts resident?
* Does Georgia recognize concealed carry licenses validly issued by other states to persons under the age of 21?
  * Example: Does Georgia recognize a valid Utah "[Provisional Concealed Firearm Permit](https://bci.utah.gov/information-about-the-provisional-concealed-firearm-permit/)" issued to a 19-year-old?

In an attempt to answer these two questions, I submitted an Open Records Request with the Georgia Attorney General's Office in September 2018. The documents that I have received in response to my request may help to shed light on these questions.

Specifically, [one document from June 2017](https://georgiafirearmreciprocity.github.io/20170607_Georgia_New_Hampshire_Reciprocity.pdf) "\[confirms] that Georgia will continue to recognize New Hampshire's resident and non-resident concealed carry licenses," and [another document from May 2017](https://georgiafirearmreciprocity.github.io/20170502_Georgia_Utah_Reciprocity.pdf) states that Georgia "recognizes" Utah's "Provisional Concealed Firearm Permit," issued to 18-20 year olds.

As most of these documents were not previously available online, the purpose of this site is to make them available. These documents include reciprocity agreements and correspondence between the Georgia Attorney General's Office and other state attorneys general, government officials, and private individuals. There are also documents from *GeorgiaCarry.Org et. al. v. Christopher Carr*, a court case pertaining to reciprocity with Virginia, which has since been dismissed after Georgia's reciprocity law was amended.

In some documents involving correspondance with private individuals, I have redacted some information using conspicuous black boxes in the interest of privacy. Otherwise, these documents have not been altered.
